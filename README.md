# Django Rest Framework / ReactJS Based Projects 


## Django Rest Framework<br/>
- Django and DRF
- Basics of Django, such as models, views, and templates
- Understand the concept of REST and HTTP
- Basics of DRF, such as serializers, views, and URLs
- Build a simple CRUD API using DRF


### Authentication and Authorization<br/>
- Learn about authentication and authorization in DRF
- Implement token-based authentication using Django's built-in authentication framework
- Implement permission classes to control access to resources
- Third-party authentication using libraries such as OAuth2 and JWT
    
### Advanced DRF Concepts<br/>
- Pagination and filtering
- Implement pagination using DRF's built-in pagination classes
- Content negotiation and serialization
- Implement custom serializer classes
- Testing and documentation in DRF
    
### Best Practices for Scalable and Secure APIs<br/>
- API versioning and URL design
- Implement versioning using URL namespaces and versioning schemes
-  Rate limiting and throttling
- Implement rate limiting and throttling using DRF's built-in classes
- Caching and performance optimization
    
### Implement caching using Django's built-in cache framework
<br/>

Best practices to keep in mind when designing scalable, secure, and paginated REST APIs with DRF

- Use HTTPS for secure communication
- Use strong authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Use proper input validation and sanitization
- Use pagination to limit the amount of data returned in a single response
- Use rate limiting and throttling to prevent abuse and overload
- Use caching to improve performance and reduce load on the database
- Follow the REST principles for resource design and HTTP methods
- Use proper error handling and response formats
- Use versioning to maintain backward compatibility with clients
